## ‚úÖ Advanced Python Coding Tasks (with Solutions)

---

### üß† **Algorithms & Data Structures**

1. **LRU Cache from Scratch**

   * Implement using `OrderedDict` or doubly linked list + dict.

2. **Custom Heap Implementation**

   * Build a min-heap and max-heap with `heapify`, `heappush`, `heappop`.

3. **Trie with Prefix Search and Auto-complete**

   * Create a trie supporting insertion, deletion, and auto-complete.

4. **Expression Evaluator**

   * Parse and evaluate expressions like `"3 + (2 * 4) / 2"` using stacks.

5. **Custom Priority Queue with Complex Rules**

   * Create a priority queue that supports dynamic priority rules.

---

### üßµ **Concurrency & Async**

6. **Producer-Consumer with Threading**

   * Use `threading`, `queue.Queue`, and `condition`.

7. **Async Web Crawler**

   * Use `asyncio` and `aiohttp` to fetch multiple URLs concurrently.

8. **Parallel File Processing**

   * Use `multiprocessing.Pool` to parse files in parallel.

9. **Rate Limiter using Token Bucket**

   * Use `asyncio` or `threading.Timer`.

10. **Deadlock Detection Simulation**

* Detect circular wait conditions using a wait-for graph.

---

### üß© **Object-Oriented and Metaprogramming**

11. **Custom Enum Implementation**

* Mimic `enum.Enum` using metaclasses.

12. **Attribute Logger**

* Use `__setattr__` to log changes to attributes.

13. **Dynamic ORM-like Model**

* Build a base class that maps attributes to SQL columns.

14. **Plugin System Using Entry Points**

* Dynamically load Python modules from a directory.

15. **Custom Context Manager**

* Use `__enter__` and `__exit__` without `contextlib`.

---

### üß∞ **Decorators and Closures**

16. **Memoization Decorator with Expiry**

* Cache function results with a TTL using a dictionary.

17. **Retry Decorator with Backoff**

* Retry failed function calls with exponential backoff.

18. **Permission-Based Decorator System**

* Apply user roles to functions for access control.

19. **Throttle Decorator**

* Prevent a function from being called more than once every N seconds.

20. **Time-Limited Function Execution**

* Timeout using `signal.alarm` (UNIX) or threads.

---

### üì¶ **Data Processing & Optimization**

21. **Memory-Efficient CSV Parser**

* Read line by line using generators.

22. **Large File Diff Tool**

* Compare files chunk by chunk without loading entire content.

23. **Streaming Median**

* Use 2 heaps to maintain running median.

24. **Bloom Filter Implementation**

* Probabilistic membership check using hash functions and bit array.

25. **Sharded Counter with Redis**

* Distribute counter across shards and aggregate results.

---

### üõ°Ô∏è **Security and Hardening**

26. **Safe Expression Evaluator**

* Parse math using `ast` safely (avoid `eval()`).

27. **Custom Password Hashing System**

* Use `bcrypt`, salt, and pepper strategies.

28. **Secure Token Generator**

* Use `secrets` module to generate cryptographic tokens.

29. **Path Traversal Prevention**

* Sanitize file input to prevent `../` access.

30. **Rate Limiter for API**

* Use in-memory dict + timestamps per user/IP.

---

### üß™ **Testing, Debugging, Introspection**

31. **Custom Test Runner**

* Discover and run test cases using `unittest` or reflection.

32. **Function Call Graph Tracer**

* Track which functions call which using decorators.

33. **Custom Assertion System**

* Raise detailed errors comparing complex nested structures.

34. **Stack Frame Inspector**

* Print variables and call stack at runtime using `inspect`.

35. **Monkey Patching in Tests**

* Override methods during test setup and restore after.

---

### üß† **Advanced Topics**

36. **Immutable Object Pattern**

* Lock down object after initialization.

37. **Job Scheduler**

* Schedule and run tasks using cron-like syntax (`schedule` lib or manual).

38. **Binary Serialization Format**

* Create a compact binary format for objects using `struct`.

39. **Python DSL Interpreter**

* Build a domain-specific language parser for rules/configs.

40. **Thread-Safe Singleton**

* Implement a singleton pattern that‚Äôs safe for multithreaded use.

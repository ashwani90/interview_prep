## âœ… 40 Object-Oriented Programming Problems & Solutions (Python)

---

### ðŸŸ¢ **Beginner Level (1â€“10)**

1. **Create a `Rectangle` class with methods for area and perimeter.**

2. **Define a `BankAccount` class with `deposit` and `withdraw` methods and balance tracking.**

3. **Create a `Book` class with title, author, and pages, and print book details.**

4. **Define a `Person` class and create subclasses like `Student` and `Teacher` with extra fields.**

5. **Create a `Dog` class with `bark()` and override it in a `GermanShepherd` subclass.**

6. **Implement a `Temperature` class that stores Celsius and converts to Fahrenheit.**

7. **Create a `Car` class that tracks speed and supports `accelerate()` and `brake()`.**

8. **Create a `Point` class that supports adding two points using operator overloading (`__add__`).**

9. **Make a `Circle` class with class variables for `pi` and methods for area/circumference.**

10. **Create a `Timer` class that uses `time.time()` to track elapsed time.**

### ðŸŸ¡ **Intermediate Level (11â€“25)**

11. **Implement a `ShoppingCart` class that holds items with prices and calculates total.**

12. **Design a `Shape` base class and implement `Triangle`, `Rectangle`, `Circle` using polymorphism.**

13. **Create a `Logger` class using the Singleton pattern.**

14. **Implement a `Matrix` class that supports matrix addition using `__add__`.**

15. **Build a `FileHandler` class that opens, reads, and writes to files using a context manager (`__enter__`, `__exit__`).**

16. **Design a `User` class that validates username and email format using private methods.**

17. **Create a `Polynomial` class to represent and evaluate polynomial expressions.**

18. **Use composition: Make a `Computer` class that contains `CPU`, `RAM`, `HardDrive` objects.**

19. **Create a `Deck` class to model a deck of cards, with shuffling and drawing functionality.**

20. **Build a `Bank` system where multiple `Customer` objects hold multiple `Account` objects.**

21. **Make a `Vector` class with magnitude, angle, and overloaded operators.**

22. **Implement a `Queue` and `Stack` class using OOP (not `collections`).**

23. **Build a `Transaction` system where each object logs its status with timestamps.**

24. **Create a `StudentRecord` class that supports comparison by GPA using `__lt__`, `__gt__`.**

25. **Use `@classmethod` and `@staticmethod` in a `DateUtility` class.**

### ðŸ”´ **Advanced Level (26â€“40)**

26. **Create a metaclass that logs all method calls of any class that uses it.**

27. **Implement a plugin architecture where classes register themselves automatically via metaclass or decorator.**

28. **Build a `ResourcePool` class using the Flyweight pattern to reuse limited objects.**

29. **Create an `Observer` pattern where listeners are notified of state changes.**

30. **Design a `State` pattern system for an `Order` object (e.g., New â†’ Paid â†’ Shipped).**

31. **Implement a `Vehicle` system using Abstract Base Classes and `abc` module.**

32. **Design a `Router` class to map URLs to functions (simulate Flask's decorator routing).**

33. **Build a `Serializer` interface and implement `JSONSerializer`, `XMLSerializer`.**

34. **Create a `Command` pattern that queues and executes undoable operations.**

35. **Simulate a real-time chat server where each `User` is a class and messages are routed between them.**

36. **Create a `Config` class using the Borg Pattern to share state across instances.**

37. **Implement a `DataPipeline` class that uses method chaining (fluent interface).**

38. **Create an `Invoice` system that generates PDFs using composition of item, pricing, and discount modules.**

39. **Build an `UndoRedoManager` class using the Command pattern.**

40. **Use descriptors to implement a `TypedField` class for enforcing type constraints on attributes.**

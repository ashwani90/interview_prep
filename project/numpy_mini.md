Great! Let's build a **NumPy-based mini project** â€” one thatâ€™s realistic, challenging, and showcases your ability to manipulate data numerically without relying on higher-level libraries like Pandas or Scikit-learn.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Project: **Image Compression using SVD (Singular Value Decomposition)**

We'll use **NumPy + Matplotlib** to compress a grayscale image using the **SVD algorithm**, which is a popular technique in linear algebra for dimensionality reduction and matrix approximation.

---

### ðŸ§  Concepts Youâ€™ll Practice

* Matrix decomposition using `np.linalg.svd`
* Low-rank matrix approximation
* Image processing with NumPy arrays
* Visualizing image quality vs compression ratio

---

### ðŸ“¦ Step-by-Step Implementation

---

#### âœ… Step 1: **Import Required Libraries**

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from PIL import Image
```

---

#### âœ… Step 2: **Load and Convert Image to Grayscale Matrix**

```python
# Load image and convert to grayscale
img = Image.open('your_image.jpg').convert('L')  # 'L' for grayscale
img_matrix = np.array(img)

print(f"Original image shape: {img_matrix.shape}")

# Show original image
plt.imshow(img_matrix, cmap='gray')
plt.title("Original Image")
plt.axis('off')
plt.show()
```

---

#### âœ… Step 3: **Perform SVD Decomposition**

```python
# SVD decomposition
U, S, VT = np.linalg.svd(img_matrix, full_matrices=False)

print(f"Shapes -> U: {U.shape}, S: {S.shape}, VT: {VT.shape}")
```

---

#### âœ… Step 4: **Define a Function to Reconstruct Image with k Components**

```python
def reconstruct_image(U, S, VT, k):
    S_k = np.diag(S[:k])
    return np.dot(U[:, :k], np.dot(S_k, VT[:k, :]))
```

---

#### âœ… Step 5: **Visualize Reconstruction at Different Compression Levels**

```python
ks = [5, 20, 50, 100, 200]

plt.figure(figsize=(15, 8))

for i, k in enumerate(ks):
    compressed_img = reconstruct_image(U, S, VT, k)
    plt.subplot(2, 3, i+1)
    plt.imshow(compressed_img, cmap='gray')
    plt.title(f"k = {k}")
    plt.axis('off')

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

---

#### âœ… Step 6: **Evaluate Compression**

```python
def compression_ratio(k, original_shape):
    m, n = original_shape
    return (k * (m + n + 1)) / (m * n)

for k in ks:
    ratio = compression_ratio(k, img_matrix.shape)
    print(f"k = {k} â†’ Compression Ratio: {ratio:.4f}")
```

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Optional Enhancements

* Apply this on **color images** by performing SVD on R, G, B channels separately.
* Add **automatic k selection** based on a quality threshold (e.g., 95% energy).
* Save compressed results as new images using `PIL`.

---

### âœ… What You'll Learn

* Real-world use of linear algebra in compression.
* Efficient handling of matrix operations in NumPy.
* Balancing trade-offs between accuracy and compression.

Would you like to:

* Try this project with **color images**?
* Extend it to **video compression (frame-by-frame)**?
* Build a **NumPy-only version of PCA** on real-world tabular data?

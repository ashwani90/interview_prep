Great! Here's a **realistic, interview-worthy mini project** using **Apache Kafka + Python (Faust)** that shows your understanding of **event streaming, message processing, stateful computation**, and **system integration**.

---

## 🛠️ Mini Project: **Real-Time Order Processing and Inventory Tracking System**

---

### ✅ Project Summary

Simulate a **real-time e-commerce platform** where orders are placed and inventory levels are updated and tracked using **Kafka topics**. Implement **order validation**, **inventory deduction**, and **alerting for low-stock items**, all in real-time.

---

### 🧱 Architecture Overview

```
[Order Producer (FastAPI)] ---> [Kafka Topic: orders]
                                         ↓
                             [Faust App: Order Processor]
                                         ↓
                       [Kafka Topic: inventory-events, alerts]
                                ↓              ↓
           [Inventory DB (Postgres)]      [Alert Emailer / Logger]
```

### 🔧 Technologies

* **Kafka** – Event stream backbone.
* **Python + Faust** – For stream processing (Kafka Streams equivalent in Python).
* **FastAPI** – For the API to simulate incoming orders.
* **PostgreSQL or Redis** – For inventory state (Faust table optional).
* **Docker + Docker Compose** – For environment setup (Kafka, Zookeeper, DB, etc.).

---

### 📦 Kafka Topics

* `orders` – Events containing new orders (product ID, quantity, etc.)
* `inventory-events` – Processed events after checking stock, updating inventory.
* `alerts` – Emitted when inventory is too low or order is rejected due to stock.

---

### 🔁 Workflow Logic

1. **Producer (FastAPI)**:

   * Endpoint to POST new orders (`/order`)
   * Sends order events to the `orders` topic

2. **Stream Processor (Faust)**:

   * Consumes from `orders`
   * Validates against current inventory
   * If valid:

     * Decrease inventory
     * Send to `inventory-events`
   * If low stock:

     * Also send alert to `alerts`

3. **Inventory State Store (Optional)**:

   * Use **Faust Tables** or PostgreSQL/Redis to store current inventory levels

4. **Alert Handler**:

   * Consumes from `alerts`
   * Sends email/logs alert to console

---

### 🧪 Sample Order Event

```json
{
  "order_id": "ORD-1299",
  "product_id": "P-567",
  "quantity": 2
}
```

---

### 📊 Inventory Table (Example)

| Product ID | Name     | In Stock |
| ---------- | -------- | -------- |
| P-567      | Mouse    | 5        |
| P-568      | Keyboard | 2        |

---

### ⚠️ Alert Example

> 🛑 Low stock alert for Product P-567: only 1 item left!

---

### ✅ Learning Outcomes

* Real-time stream processing with Kafka
* Topic creation, partitioning, and producer/consumer setup
* Stateless and stateful stream logic using Faust
* Fault-tolerance via durable Kafka topics
* API integration with streaming systems

---

### 💡 Bonus Ideas

* Add schema validation with **Avro + Schema Registry**
* Add **Grafana + Prometheus** for real-time monitoring
* Integrate with **ClickHouse** for analytics
* Use **Debezium** to capture DB changes instead of order API

Sure! Let's break down **OAuth** and other common authentication (auth) types, including the **theory** behind them, in a way that’s clear and structured. We'll explain:

---

### 🧠 What is Authentication vs Authorization?

| Term               | Meaning                                                                 |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Authentication** | Verifying **who** the user is (login).                                  |
| **Authorization**  | Verifying **what** the user has access to (permissions, roles, scopes). |

---

## 🔐 1. **Basic Authentication (HTTP Basic Auth)**

### 🔸 How it Works:

* Client sends a **username\:password** pair encoded in base64 in the `Authorization` header.
* Example:
  `Authorization: Basic dXNlcjpwYXNzd29yZA==`

### 🔸 Theory:

* Simple, stateless.
* Sent with every request.
* Relies on HTTPS to be secure.

### 🔸 Problems:

* Passwords sent every time.
* No logout.
* Not ideal for APIs or public apps.

---

## 🪪 2. **Session-Based Authentication**

### 🔸 How it Works:

* User logs in → server verifies credentials → creates a session ID → stored in **cookie**.
* On each request, browser sends cookie.
* Session data stored **server-side** (e.g., in memory, Redis).

### 🔸 Theory:

* Relies on state stored on server.
* Suitable for traditional web apps.

### 🔸 Pros:

* Widely supported.
* Simple to implement.

### 🔸 Cons:

* Not scalable without session sharing.
* Doesn’t work well for APIs or mobile.

---

## 🛡 3. **Token-Based Authentication (e.g., JWT)**

### 🔸 How it Works:

* User logs in → server returns a **token** (often a JWT).
* Token is stored client-side (e.g., localStorage) and sent in `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header.
* Server validates token (signature, expiration, etc).

### 🔸 JWT = JSON Web Token

A compact, URL-safe token format with:

* **Header**: Algorithm & type.
* **Payload**: Claims (user ID, role, etc.).
* **Signature**: To verify data integrity.

### 🔸 Theory:

* Stateless authentication.
* Token can be passed between services (microservices, APIs).

### 🔸 Pros:

* Scales well.
* No need to store session on server.

### 🔸 Cons:

* Token cannot be revoked easily (except by blacklisting).
* Sensitive to XSS if stored improperly.

## 🌍 4. **OAuth 2.0**

### 🔸 What is OAuth?

OAuth is **an authorization framework**, not authentication, that allows **third-party apps** to access user data **without giving them the password**.

> Example: "Log in with Google / GitHub / Facebook"

### 🔸 Key Roles:

| Role                     | Description                                               |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Resource Owner**       | You (the user).                                           |
| **Client**               | The app that wants access (e.g., a Twitter client).       |
| **Authorization Server** | Issues tokens (e.g., Google OAuth server).                |
| **Resource Server**      | API holding user data (e.g., Google Drive, GitHub repos). |

---

### 🔸 OAuth 2.0 Flow (Authorization Code)

1. User clicks “Log in with Google”
2. Redirected to Google login
3. User logs in → grants access
4. Google redirects back with an **authorization code**
5. App exchanges code for **access token**
6. App uses access token to access API

### 🔐 Tokens:

* **Access Token**: Short-lived, used to access APIs.
* **Refresh Token**: Long-lived, used to get new access tokens.

---

### 🔸 Use Cases:

* Third-party access without password sharing.
* Mobile & single-page apps.
* Delegated access (e.g., share your calendar with another app).

---

## 👥 5. OpenID Connect (OIDC)

> 🔹 **Built on top of OAuth 2.0**
> 🔹 Adds **authentication** to OAuth

* When you use "Login with Google", you're often using **OpenID Connect**.
* It adds an **ID token** (a JWT with user info).

### 🔸 ID Token vs Access Token:

| Token        | Purpose                 |
| ------------ | ----------------------- |
| ID Token     | Who the user is (login) |
| Access Token | What they can access    |

---

## 🔄 Summary Table

| Type             | Stateless | Stores on Server | Token? | Best For                  |
| ---------------- | --------- | ---------------- | ------ | ------------------------- |
| Basic Auth       | ✅         | ❌                | ❌      | Testing, very simple APIs |
| Session Auth     | ❌         | ✅                | ❌      | Web apps with login       |
| Token Auth (JWT) | ✅         | ❌                | ✅      | SPAs, mobile, APIs        |
| OAuth2           | ✅         | Optional         | ✅      | Delegated access, APIs    |
| OpenID Connect   | ✅         | Optional         | ✅      | SSO, login with Google    |

---

## ✅ Final Notes

* Use **session-based auth** for server-rendered apps.
* Use **JWT or OAuth** for APIs, mobile apps, or SPAs.
* Use **OpenID Connect** if you need both login and identity info.

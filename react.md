## üß† 20 Intermediate-Level Tasks Using React Query

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è 1. **Fetch and Cache Paginated Data**

* Use `useInfiniteQuery` or `useQuery` with `page` param.
* Implement ‚ÄúLoad More‚Äù button or infinite scroll.
* Cache previous pages for smooth UX.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è 2. **Prefetch Data Before Navigation**

* Prefetch a query (e.g., user profile or product) before navigating.
* Use `queryClient.prefetchQuery`.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è 3. **Invalidate Queries on Mutation**

* After a `createPost` mutation, invalidate the `getPosts` query.
* Ensure the UI updates automatically with the new post.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è 4. **Use Query Keys with Dynamic Parameters**

* Query posts by `userId`.
* Ensure separate caches are created for each unique `userId`.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è 5. **Dependent Queries**

* Fetch user info only after auth token is available.
* Use `enabled: !!token` to conditionally fire the query.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è 6. **Use `onSuccess` and `onError` Callbacks**

* Show a toast on mutation success or error.
* Log additional data in a custom handler.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è 7. **Handle Query Errors Gracefully**

* Show a retry button if a query fails.
* Display custom error messages from API.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è 8. **Implement Global Loading Spinner**

* Show spinner while any query is fetching.
* Use `isFetching` from `useIsFetching()` globally.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è 9. **Stale Time vs Cache Time Exploration**

* Set `staleTime` and `cacheTime` for queries.
* Observe when background refetching happens.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è 10. **Polling / Interval Queries**

* Poll an API every 10 seconds for real-time updates (e.g., stock prices).
* Use `refetchInterval`.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è 11. **Manually Trigger a Query Refetch**

* Add a "Refresh" button that calls `refetch()`.
* Use `refetchOnWindowFocus: false` to avoid automatic refetch.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è 12. **Optimistic UI for Like Button**

* Immediately show ‚Äúliked‚Äù state before mutation completes.
* Roll back on error using `onError` and `context`.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è 13. **Cancel In-Flight Requests**

* Cancel ongoing queries when navigating away or switching tabs.
* Useful for large datasets or slow APIs.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è 14. **Use Select to Transform Query Data**

* Use `select` to extract or modify data from the response.
* Example: Return only the first 5 items from a list.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è 15. **Hydrate Server-Fetched Data in SSR**

* Fetch data on the server with `dehydrate`.
* Rehydrate in React with `Hydrate`.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è 16. **Use `useMutation` for File Upload**

* Upload an image file using `FormData`.
* Track upload progress (integrate with Axios if needed).

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è 17. **Paginated Search with React Query**

* Use `queryKey` with `searchTerm` + `page`.
* Invalidate and reset pagination on new search.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è 18. **Query Cancellation on Component Unmount**

* Ensure in-flight queries are aborted when a component is removed.
* Verify via network logs or loading state.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è 19. **Persist React Query Cache to LocalStorage**

* Use `react-query-persist-client`.
* Restore cached data on page reload for instant UX.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è 20. **Global Error Handling via QueryClient**

* Customize `QueryClient` with a global `onError`.
* Useful for logging out on 401 responses across the app.

---

### üöÄ Bonus Ideas (For Advanced Follow-Up)

* Integrate with websocket for hybrid real-time/reactive updates.
* Build a retry strategy with exponential backoff.
* Use devtools (`@tanstack/react-query-devtools`) to monitor and debug.
